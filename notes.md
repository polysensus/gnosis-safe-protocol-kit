# snags, gotchas and learnings

* Following [this guide](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/protocol-kit)
* Getting test eth requires holding 0.001 ETH in the corresponding wallet on Ethereum. its a PITA, trying the guide using base-goerli
* Easier to use OP, but requires briding, the faucets get OP tokens, but we need ETH in the address on OP
* https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit

* Need to manually create package.json - that is not in the guide
* it is definitely possible to deploy the full gnosis safe contract set to any chain (including RRR)
